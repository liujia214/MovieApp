Movie App:


HTML: html/index.html
JS: js/service.js
CSS: css/base.scss


Layout consists of top, left and right.
Used normalize.css to reset browser and Sass as processor.
Used Angular controller and service to get movie information from external API, and ng-repeat directive to display data on page.
For focus part, used ng-class directive to add and remove style dynamically.
